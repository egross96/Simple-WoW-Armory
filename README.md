  Note: This web app is <i>intentionally</i> vulnerable. I used this a variety of times for security demonstrations throughout my bachelor's degree, including but not limited to SQL Injections, Reflected XSS, and Stored XSS attacks. This was done hosting the product on AWS Lightsail and then visiting it through a virtual machine running Kali linux.
